Is the timer support on your system really correct?  Do we support it?

Here are some things an "effective" timer-system provides:
  (1) dsk_dispatch_add_timer_millis(),
      dsk_dispatch_adjust_timer_millis() operate 
      with a monotonic clock, unaffected by settimeofday()
  (2) dsk_dispatch_add_timer, dsk_dispatch_adjust_timer
      operate with a wall-clock time clock that will notify us
      if someone calls settimeofday().

Most users don't even really notice an ineffective timer system,
b/c everyone has low hopes regarding settimeofday() handling,
(although some major fixes are easy: eg lack of settimeofday() notification).

Changes in user's timezone are a different (but very related) issue.


BACKWARDS SYSTEMS SUPPORTED:
  - just using gettimeofday() (which means assuming the wall-clock
    is a good monotonic clock)

UNSUPPORTED SYSTEMS:
  - linux's create_timer_fd

SUPPORTED SYSTEMS:
