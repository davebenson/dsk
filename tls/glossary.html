 <b>AES</b>: Advanced Encryption Standard.  A standardized <i>block cipher</i>.
Invented by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen.
<i>NIST</i> standardized some variants into FIPS 197.  All standard AES algorithms have
a block-size of 128-bits.  The key-size may be 128, 192, or 256 bits.
For our purposes,
</li>

<li>
 AEAD, Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data:
 a means to convert a block cipher into one that can accept
 variable length plaintext and perform authentication.  (It also
 can provide authenticated but unencrypted data, called "associated data"
 which in TLS 1.3 is used to validate the plaintext outer header.)
 (<i>GCM</i> and <i>CCM</i> as well as <i>CHACHA-20 + Poly1305</i>
 are the AEAD required by TLS 1.3)
</li>

<li>
  ASN.1 - an old serialization format used by X.509 keys, specified in the
  fairly easy to understand ITU Rec X.690, old versions of which are available for free.
  It actually defines three very similar formats: BER (Basic Encoding Rules),
  CER (Canonical Encoding Rules), and DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules).
  BER is the most lenient (in terms of allowing multiple encodings for values).
  DER is the one used by X509 and generally results in exactly one way to encode each
  ASN.1 entity.
</li>

<li>
 <p>
 <b>Block cipher</b>: a way of encrypting data of a fixed size
 using a key known to the encryptor and decryptor.  
 The encrypted and decrypted data is of the same length, usually 16 bytes.
 </p>

 <p>
 These tend to do the heavy
 work of the encryption algorithm, but they need to be coupled with
 a means to check the authenticity and integrity of the message.
 </p>
</li>

<li>
 <b>Ciphertext</b>: the encrypted data
</li>

<li>
 Curve 25519 - a fast algorithm for Key Sharing designed and developed by Daniel Bernstein
 for key-sharing and 
</li>

<li>
 <b>Cryptographic Hash</b>: A function that computes a fixed-length byte-string (the "hash")
 for each input byte-string, where it is hard to generate a partial inverse (ie one
 that finds a byte-string for a given hash).
</li>

<li>
 DER: often used as a description of the format of X509 certs,
 it refers to an encoding of ASN.1.
</li>

<li>
 DES: a series of encryption standards developed by
 the US government that are now considered to be too weak,
 in part due to its 56-bit key.  And its also slow compared to modern algorithms.
 Essentially, it's been replaced by AES.
</li>

<li>
  GCM "Galois/Counter Mode": <i>mode of operation</i> and <i>AEAD</i>
  that converts a block cipher into a variable-length
  cipher with authentication.
  It uses a finite-field with power-of-two order (finite fields
  are sometimes called Galois fields).
</li>

<li>
 ECB, a classical <i>mode of operation</i> for a block cipher.
 It's trivial: simply break the input into blocks,
 encrypt or decrypt them,
 and concatenate the results.
 Cannot handle arbitrary length data,
 and is susceptible to replay and reordering attacks.
</li>

<li>
 <b>Group</b> - a group is a set with an invertible, associative
 operator.
 <p>Cryptographic groups tends to be very large, and
 they rely on the difficulty of "logarithms" on this group's operation.</p>
 <p>Key-Share (aka Diffie-Hellman) mechansims use
 the fact that repeatedly applying a group-element to itself is
 readily optimisable, but computing the number of times given the output
 is hard.  (This is usually called the "discrete logarithm problem").
 </p>
</li>

<li>
 <b>HMAC</b> - Hashed Message Authentication Code.
 Takes a secret key and a message and generates a signature that can be validated
 by someone who has the secret key, using a cryptographic hash-function.
</li>

<li>
  Elliptic Curve Cryptography.  Heavy-duty cryptography used for assymmetric operations like
  key-exchange and signatures.  
</li>

<li>
  Key Exchange.  In TLS, this is the most common way to set up a symmetric key arrangement.
  <br>
  As of TLS 1.3 it is done by the KeyShare extension.
  <br>
  As a practical matter, it involves three steps:
    <ul>
      <li>each side computes a public key and private key that match (they use a secure
      random-number-generator to seed the key generation process).
      Most such algorithms actually have a function to compute
      the public key from the private key, but this interface
      generates them simultaneously.</li>
      <li>each side shares its public key</li>
      <li>the private key + the other side's public key are
          combined into a shared key (ie the computation will result
            in the same shared data: shared = A_private+B_public = B_private+A_publicM
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>Key Exchange takes advantage of mathematical problem that is believed
  to be difficult.  Older algorithms (Diffie-Hellman) use the difficulty of
  computing the "modular logarithm".
  (Even older strategies exist that use the difficulty of factor the product of large primes.
  the product of large primes.)
  </p>
  <p>
  By taking advantage of every known trick, and inventing a bunch more,
  Daniel J Bernstein submitted curve-25519 to various standard organizations,
  and it is so much more efficient than the alternatives that nobody really
  uses other key-share algorithms in practice.
  (Furthermore, his technique is deliberately designed to avoid many subtle attacks)

    Key-Whitening - 
      Hokey technique of XOR-ing fixed block-sized data to
      a the inputs and outputs of a block-cipher, to slightly
      scramble it if you can pre-share a key.  This is similar
      to salting a password hash.
      <br/>
      That said, the first and last steps of AES are
      essentially key-whitening steps.

  <b>Public Key Infrastructure</b> - A means of validating a certificate-chain
  against a list of trusted certification-authorities.  Certificates of length 1
  usually are called Self-Signed Certificates, and don't provide any authentication security.
  Most of the time, certificate chains are length 2: the issuer and the issuee.
</li>
<li>
  <p>Record Layer: the outermost layer of TLS,
  which is very light, since all encryption occurs under this layer.
  <br>
  Encryption changes must occur in between records (ie records must only use one
  type of encryption).
  <br>
  And records must not comingle handshake and application data.
  <br>
  But messages may otherwise by combined and split as they are moved into records.

about the encryption process that are beyond the formal inputs and outputs
of the algorithm.
There are two known approaches: (1) compression attacks (2) timing attacks.

  <b>SHA-2</b>: SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, SHA512/224, SHA512/256, SHA512/384 - a family of cryptographic hash functions.  The first two are based on a 32-bit word operation; and the last 4 are based
  on 64-bit operations.  There's only two real hash functions, with
  SHA224 being a truncation of SHA256, and SHA384, SHA512/224 and SHA512/384 are
  truncations of SHA512.

  SSL "Secure Socket Layer", the predecessor to TLS.  Although the protocol has been
  replaced by TLS, people still refer to SSL as the secure protocol, even though actual
