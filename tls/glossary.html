<li>
 <b>AES</b>: Advanced Encryption Standard.  A standardized <i>block cipher</i>.
Invented by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen.
<i>NIST</i> standardized some variants into FIPS 197.  All standard AES algorithms have
a block-size of 128-bits.  The key-size may be 128, 192, or 256 bits.
For our purposes,
</li>

<li>
 AEAD, Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data:
 a means to convert a block cipher into one that can accept
 variable length plaintext and perform authentication.  (It also
 can provide authenticated but unencrypted data, called "associated data"
 which is needed for ...) (<i>GCM</i> and <i>CCM</i> are the AEAD required
 by TLS 1.3)
</li>

<li>
 <p>
 <b>Block cipher</b>: a way of encrypting data of a fixed size
 using a key known to the encryptor and decryptor.  
 They involve a routine pre-compute for a key ("Key Expansion"),
 then an optimized routine to do the block-decryption/encryption.
 </p>

 <p>
 These tend to do the heavy
 work of the encryption algorithm, but they need to be coupled with
 a means to check the authenticity and integrity of the message.
 </p>
</li>

<li>
 <b>Ciphertext</b>: the encrypted data
</li>

<li>
 <b>Cryptographic Hash</b>: A function that computes a fixed-length byte-string (the "hash")
 for each input byte-string, where it is hard to generate a partial inverse (ie one
 that finds a byte-string for a given hash).

<li>
 DES: a series of encryption standards developed by
 the US government that are now considered to be too weak,
 in part due to its 56-bit key.  And its also slow compared to modern algorithms.
 Essentially, it's been replaced by AES.
</li>

<li>
  GCM "Galois/Counter Mode": <i>mode of operation</i> and <i>AEAD</i>
  that converts a block cipher into a variable-length
  cipher with authentication.
  It uses a finite-field with power-of-two order (finite fields
  are sometimes called Galois fields).
</li>

<li>
 ECB, a classical <i>mode of operation</i> for a block cipher.
 It's trivial: simply break the input into blocks,
 encrypt or decrypt them,
 and concatenate the results.
 Cannot handle arbitrary length data,
 and is susceptible to replay and reordering attacks.
</li>

<li>
 <b>HMAC</b> - Hashed Message Authentication Code.
 Takes a secret key and a message and generates a signature that can be validated
 by someone who has the secret key, using a cryptographic hash-function.
</li>

<li>
  Elliptic Curve Cryptography.  Heavy-duty cryptography used for assymmetric operations like
  key-exchange and signatures.  
</li>

<li>
  Key Exchange.  In TLS, this is the most common way to set up a symmetric key arrangement.
  As a practical matter, it involves three steps:
      (1) each side computes a public key and private key that match;
      (2) each side shares its public key
      (3) the private key + the other side's public key are
          combined into a shared key (ie the computation will result
            in the same shared data: shared = A_private+B_public = B_private+A_public
</li>

<li>
 MAC - Message Authentication Code
 Takes a secret key and a message and generates a signature that can be validated
 by someone who has the secret key.
</li>

<li>
 MD5 - a venerable, but deprecated, cryptographic hash.  Still widely used.
</li>

<li>
 <b>Nonce</b> - A value that is used only once, often to avoid <i>replay attacks</i>.
</li>
<li>
  Octet: a term used in RFC standards for "byte", an 8-bit value,
  usually represented as a number in the range 0 to 255.
</li>

<li>
  <b>Plaintext</b>: the unencrypted data: either the input to the encryption
  algorithm, or, equivalently, the output of the decryption algorithm.
</li>

<li>
  <p>Record Layer: the outermost layer of TLS,
  which is very light, since all encryption occurs under this layer.
  <br>
  Encryption changes must occur in between records (ie records must only use one
  type of encryption).
  <br>
  And records must not comingle handshake and application data.
  <br>
  But messages may otherwise by combined and split as they are moved into records.
  </p>
</li>

<li>
  SHA1 - a venerable, cryptographic hash, whose output is 160 bits long (20 bytes).
  Still widely used, although some attacks have been found (including some collisions).
</li>

<li>
  SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512 - a family of cryptographic hash functions, collectively
  standardized as SHA2.
  The number gives the number of bits of output.
</li>

<li>
  SSL "Secure Socket Layer", the predecessor to TLS.  Although the protocol has been
  replaced by TLS, people still refer to SSL as the secure protocol, even though actual
  SSL connections are rarely seen in the wild. [as of 2019]
</li>

<li>
  TLS "Transport Layer Security", the modern protocol for securing internet connections.
