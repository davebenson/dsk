<li>
 <b>AES</b>: Advanced Encryption Standard.  A standardized <i>block cipher</i>.
Invented by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen.  <i>NIST</i> accepted
128-, 192- and 256-bit variants.  For our purposes,
<a href="...">FIPS 197</a> specifies this algorithm.
</li>

<li>
 AEAD, Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data:
 a means to convert a block cipher into one that can accept
 variable length plaintext and perform authentication.  (It also
 can provide authenticated but unencrypted data, called "associated data"
 which is needed for ...) (<i>GCM</i> and <i>CCM</i> are the AEAD required
 by TLS 1.3)
</li>

<li>
 <b>Block cipher</b>: a way of encrypting data of a fixed size
 using a key known to the encryptor and decryptor.  
 They involve a routine pre-compute for a key ("Key Expansion"),
 then an optimized routine to do the block-decryption/encryption.

 These tend to do the heavy
 work of the encryption algorithm, but they need to be coupled with
 a means to check the authenticity and integrity of the message.
</li>

<li>
 <b>Ciphertext</b>: the encrypted data
</li>

<li>
 DES: a series of encryption standards developed by
 the US government that are now considered to be too weak,
 in part due to its 56-bit key, and slower modern algorithms.
 Essentially, it's been replaced by AES.
</li>

<li>
  GCM "Galois/Counter Mode": <i>mode of operation</i> and <i>AEAD</i>
  that converts a block cipher into a variable-length
  cipher with authentication.
  It uses a finite-field with power-of-two order (finite fields
  are sometimes called Galois fields).
</li>


<li>
 ECB, a classical <i>mode of operation</i> for a block cipher.
 It's trivial: simply break the input into blocks,
 encrypt or decrypt them,
 and concatenate the results.
 Cannot handle arbitrary length data,
 and is susceptible to replay and reordering attacks.

 <b>HMAC</b> - Message Authentication Code

<li>
 MAC - Message Authentication Code
</li>

<li>
 MD5 - a venerable, but deprecated, cryptographic hash.  Still widely used.
</li>

<li>
 <b>Nonce</b> - A value that is used only once, often to avoid <i>replay attacks</i>.
</li>
<li>
 Octet: a term used in RFC standards for "byte", an 8-bit value,
 usually represented as a number in the range 0 to 255.
</li>
<li>
 <b>Plaintext</b>: the unencrypted data: either the input to the encryption
 algorithm, or, equivalently, the output of the decryption algorithm.
</li>

<li>
 SHA1 - a venerable, cryptographic hash.  Still widely used.
