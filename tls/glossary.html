 <b>AES</b>: Advanced Encryption Standard.  A standardized <i>block cipher</i>.
Invented by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen.
<i>NIST</i> standardized some variants into FIPS 197.  All standard AES algorithms have
a block-size of 128-bits.  The key-size may be 128, 192, or 256 bits.
For our purposes,
</li>

<li>
 AEAD, Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data:
 a means to convert a block cipher into one that can accept
 variable length plaintext and perform authentication.  (It also
 can provide authenticated but unencrypted data, called "associated data"
 which is needed for ...) (<i>GCM</i> and <i>CCM</i> are the AEAD required
 by TLS 1.3)
</li>

<li>
  ASN.1 - an old serialization format used by X.509 keys, specified in the
  fairly easy to understand ITU Rec X.690, old versions of which are available for free.
  It actually defines three related formats: BER (Basic Encoding Rules),
  CER (Canonical Encoding Rules), and DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules).
  The latter is the one used by X509 and generally results in one way to encode each
  ASN.1 entity.
</li>

<li>
 <p>
 <b>Block cipher</b>: a way of encrypting data of a fixed size
 using a key known to the encryptor and decryptor.  
 They involve a routine pre-compute for a key ("Key Expansion"),
 then an optimized routine to do the block-decryption/encryption.
 </p>

 <p>
 These tend to do the heavy
 work of the encryption algorithm, but they need to be coupled with
 a means to check the authenticity and integrity of the message.
 </p>
</li>

<li>
 <b>Ciphertext</b>: the encrypted data
</li>

<li>
 Curve 25519 - a fast algorithm for Key Sharing
</li>

<li>
 <b>Cryptographic Hash</b>: A function that computes a fixed-length byte-string (the "hash")
 for each input byte-string, where it is hard to generate a partial inverse (ie one
 that finds a byte-string for a given hash).
</li>

<li>
 DER: often used as a description of the format of X509 certs,
 it refers to an encoding of ASN.1.  The competition is the PEM format.
</li>

<li>
 DES: a series of encryption standards developed by
 the US government that are now considered to be too weak,
 in part due to its 56-bit key.  And its also slow compared to modern algorithms.
 Essentially, it's been replaced by AES.
</li>

<li>
  GCM "Galois/Counter Mode": <i>mode of operation</i> and <i>AEAD</i>
  that converts a block cipher into a variable-length
  cipher with authentication.
  It uses a finite-field with power-of-two order (finite fields
  are sometimes called Galois fields).
</li>

<li>
 ECB, a classical <i>mode of operation</i> for a block cipher.
 It's trivial: simply break the input into blocks,
 encrypt or decrypt them,
 and concatenate the results.
 Cannot handle arbitrary length data,
 and is susceptible to replay and reordering attacks.
</li>

<li>
 <b>Group</b> - a group is a set with an invertible, associative
 operator.
 <p>Cryptographic groups tends to be very large, and
 they rely on the difficulty of "logarithms" on this group's operation.</p>
 <p>Key-Share (aka Diffie-Hellman) mechansims use
 the fact that repeatedly applying a group-element to itself is
 readily optimisable, but computing the number of times given the output
 is hard.  (This is usually called the "discrete logarithm problem").
 </p>
</li>

<li>
 <b>HMAC</b> - Hashed Message Authentication Code.
 Takes a secret key and a message and generates a signature that can be validated
 by someone who has the secret key, using a cryptographic hash-function.
</li>

<li>
  Elliptic Curve Cryptography.  Heavy-duty cryptography used for assymmetric operations like
  key-exchange and signatures.  
</li>

<li>
  Key Exchange.  In TLS, this is the most common way to set up a symmetric key arrangement.
  As a practical matter, it involves three steps:
    <ul>
      <li>each side computes a public key and private key that match (they use a secure
      random-number-generator to seed the key generation process).
      Most such algorithms actually have a function to compute
      the public key from the private key, but this interface
      generates them simultaneously.</li>
      <li>each side shares its public key</li>
      <li>the private key + the other side's public key are
          combined into a shared key (ie the computation will result
            in the same shared data: shared = A_private+B_public = B_private+A_publicM
      </li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li>
  Key Sharing - a synonym for Key Exchange.

 MAC - Message Authentication Code
 Takes a secret key and a message and generates a signature that can be validated
 by someone who has the secret key.

  Octet: a term used in RFC standards for "byte", an 8-bit value,
  usually represented as a number in the range 0 to 255.

  algorithm, or, equivalently, the output of the decryption algorithm.
</li>
<li>
  Pre-Shared Key - a mechanism to save and restore the TLS session state.
  Can be used to improvement connection times.
</li>
<li>
  <b>Public Key Infrastructure</b> - ...
</li>
<li>
  <p>Record Layer: the outermost layer of TLS,
  which is very light, since all encryption occurs under this layer.
  <br>
  Encryption changes must occur in between records (ie records must only use one
  type of encryption).
  <br>
  And records must not comingle handshake and application data.
  <br>
  But messages may otherwise by combined and split as they are moved into records.
