_ standard TableFile
  _ document plan
  _ finish implementation
  _ implement zlib compression
  _ implement Snappy compression
  _ checksum support? - aka entropy protection
  _ deletion support?
    _ this should involve adding MERGE_DROP support back in,
      AND re-adding the IsDeleted function.
    _ should this be an output of the merge function, or a separate function, or both.
      use cases:
      _ timestamp-based expiration - best if only implemented on a total merge pass,
        but should also be avail as a separate function for entries that 
      _ deletion-marker - must be implemented
