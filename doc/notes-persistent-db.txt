- a replicating, auto-adjusting layer should be built atop a normal database
- the current server config gives a list of host/ports and ranges
  of data that that partition handles
- data should only be written to the first node (which will
  pass it along to mirrors) that is responsible for the data;
  it will forward the insertions to the appropriate mirrors
  (this guarantees synchronizedness)
- when a node comes online it will be assigned a range to mirror.
  it will connect to authorities for that.
- after it is done mirroring, it may become an authority for that range
